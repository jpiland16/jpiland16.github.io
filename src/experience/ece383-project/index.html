        Code is available on <a href="https://gitlab.oit.duke.edu/jcp72/ece383-final-project" target="_blank">GitLab</a> and <a href="https://github.com/jpiland16/ece383-final-project" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.
        <h3>Summary of accomplishments</h3>
        <p>
            The UR5e is a commonly used robotic arm due to its versatility for pick-and-place operations, and it is also used for
            medical applications such as the precise positioning of <a href="https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1741-2552/ad0add" target="_blank" >transcranial magnetic stimulation</a> devices and
            (more recently) <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9561924" target="_blank" >ultrasound image acquisition</a>. Essential to the success of applications of this robot
            are tests conducted <i>in silico</i> (in simulation) to ensure the safety of the users of the robot. Despite this
            requirement, however, easy-to-implement models of the robotic arm with an end effector attached are extremely scarce,
            and documentation on modifying the simulation environment is incomplete.
        </p>
        <p>
            In this project, we <a href="https://tinyurl.com/ur5e-robotiq-help" target="_blank">documented</a> the exact steps
            necessary to create a modified simulation environment and add the end effector to the robot. In addition, an <a href="https://github.com/jpiland16/ece383-final-project/blob/master/install.sh" target="_blank" >installation
            script</a> was developed such that individuals could easily begin work on their section of the project without having to modify system files. Relevant 
            configuration files that required modification were duplicated from their previously installed locations in each package, and individually modified after making a copy,
            ensuring that the original files were preserved and reducing the complexity to a two-command installation process.
        </p>
        <p>
            Precise placement of the token above the board was achieved using a feedback loop where the position of the model
            was obtained from the simulation environment, the inverse transformation from the token to the end effector calculated, 
            and this transformation applied to the desired position to obtain the next goal position. A simulated camera was used
            to create an image of the board, and processed using computer vision to determine the move entered by the user when 
            playing against the robot. Finally, the state of the board was entered into the solved version of <a href="https://github.com/PascalPons/connect4" target="_blank">Connect4 implemented by
            PascalPons</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
            By combining precise placement of the token with computer vision and a fully solved version of the game,
            we developed an opponent that is unbeatable (as long as it is allowed to play first).
